      </p>

      <p> I'm an experienced software developer, mostly familiar with C++,
        Rust, Java. I started coding when I was 10 as a hobby, little did I
        know I would do it for the rest of my life. I've been coding for about
        7-8 years now, building up experience along the way.</p>

      <p>Within those 7-8 years I have learnt many different kinds of
        libraries, languages and paradigms. This has led me to be a very
        self-sufficient and time-efficient programmer.</p>

      <p>More recently I started to learn graphics and game development,
        starting projects such as an open-source game engine utilizing C++ and
        Vulkan, an open-source voxel engine utilizing Rust and Bevy, and many
        more projects.</p>

      <p>Over the years I've made several public projects on my GitHub, mainly
        for fun and to give to the community, A couple of these can be found
        below</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/therealnv6/vx-gfx">vx-gfx</a></p>
          <p>This is my old open-source attempt at making a Vulkan game
            engine, however is now no longer maintained. This was my second
            attempt, however some things went wrong in my pre-made dependency
            graph that I lined out. Therefore I decided to start from scratch
            and use proper conventions, including vulkan hpp RAII. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/therealnv6/termrend">termrend</a></p>
          <p>This is a very simple fun project that I made in school because I
            was bored. It's a simple software terminal renderer, and it can
            render a couple of polygons, including triangles, rectangles,
            squares, and more to come. Not actively maintained, I just work on
            it every now and then. </p>

          <p style="color: var(--link-color)">C++</p>
          <p>
            I started using C++ many years ago, about 6, but stopped using it
            after a while, simply because it was too hard for me at the time, and
            I didn't like the syntax. I recently started using C++ again to work
            on game development, primarily using Vulkan and OpenGL. I have fallen
            in love with the language and I'm looking to start many more projects
            utilizing it.
          </p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p style="color: var(--link-color)">Rust</p>
          <p>
            I have made many projects in Rust in the past, in many different
            categories. These include game development utilizing bevy and
            wgpu-rs, I've also made several different libraries for Rust and have
            published them on crates.io.
          </p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p style="color: var(--link-color)">Java</p>
          <p>I started my programming journey with Java, starting with Minecraft
            plugins. I have worked for many different servers within the
            Minecraft community, and I'm extremely experienced in it. </p>
